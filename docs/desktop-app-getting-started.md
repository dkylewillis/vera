# Run the desktop app

VERA's desktop app is an Electron application with a React interface and a
local Python sidecar. It currently runs from a repository checkout; there is
not yet a published installer or package-manager release.

## Requirements

- Git
- Python 3.10 or newer
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- Node.js and npm
- Windows (the current root development script and packaged build target Windows)

## Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dkylewillis/vera.git
cd vera
```

All remaining commands in this guide run from the repository root.

## Install the app dependencies

Install the Electron and React dependencies:

```bash
npm run app:install
```

The development command uses `uv` to create or update the Python environment
and install the `vera-app` sidecar and `vera-doc` engine.

## Start the development app

```bash
npm run app:dev
```

This starts the Vite development server and then opens the Electron window.
Keep the terminal running while using the app. Press `Ctrl+C` in that terminal
to stop both processes.

Open a PDF from the app's Convert view to create a `.vera` archive, or use the
native File menu to open an existing archive or document library.

## Large document libraries

Collection indexes are persistent: the app checks their freshness when a
library is activated but does not rebuild them automatically. Activating a
folder only sets the Search and Ask scope; the corpus opens on the first
query. A fresh index makes that first search fast. If an index is missing or
stale, large libraries prompt you to build or update it. Use **Deep inspect**
in the Info view only when you need library metrics or to revalidate every
archive; that operation can take substantially longer for large libraries.

Parent and empty folders can also be activated as libraries. Nested `.vera`
files are discovered recursively when there is no saved index configuration.
A folder with no `.vera` files remains active and watched; Search and Ask
report that nothing is searchable until archives are present.

## Check or build the app

Run the TypeScript checks:

```bash
npm run app:typecheck
```

Build the renderer and Electron main process:

```bash
npm run app:build
```

Create an unpacked desktop build, including the packaged Python sidecar:

```bash
npm run app:dist
```

On Windows, the unpacked executable is written to
`packages/vera-app/release/win-unpacked/VERA.exe`.

Create the distributable Windows installer:

```bash
npm run app:release
```

This removes the existing `packages/vera-app/release` directory, rebuilds the
app and Python sidecar, and writes an NSIS installer into that directory.

## Common startup problems

- **`uv` is not recognized** — install `uv`, open a new terminal, and rerun the
  command from the repository root.
- **`npm` is not recognized** — install Node.js, open a new terminal, and
  confirm `node --version` and `npm --version` work.
- **Electron dependencies are missing** — rerun `npm run app:install`.
- **The Electron window does not open** — check the `npm run app:dev` terminal
  for a Python sidecar, TypeScript, Vite, or port error before restarting it.

## Provider request errors

LLM authentication, credit, rate-limit, and model errors appear in a compact,
dismissible banner. The failed prompt is restored in the composer so it can be
edited or retried without restarting the app. HTTP 401 and 403 errors usually
require checking the saved API key or account permissions; HTTP 402 errors
require provider credits or a lower-cost model.

If a provider has no endpoint that supports image input, VERA retries the
request with text only and adds a note to the assistant response explaining
that the images were omitted.

While an answer is generating, the send button becomes a stop button. Selecting
it cancels only that answer, stops its active provider stream, and saves the
user prompt plus any streamed response received so far without restarting the
local sidecar.

For implementation details and the sidecar protocol, see the
[desktop app architecture](desktop-app-architecture.md).

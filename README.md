# VERA — Vector-Embedded Retrieval Archive

VERA is a Vector-Embedded Retrieval Archive: one SQLite `.vera` file that carries a document **and** everything needed to search it — parsed structure, chunks, embeddings, keyword index, figures, and citation metadata.

Tagline: **Convert once. Search anywhere.**

## What is VERA?

       no vector database, and no re-ingestion
```

A search result always points back to its source: filename, page range, heading path, score, and the figures on those pages.

## Quick start

```bash
vera convert input.pdf output.vera
vera inspect output.vera
vera validate output.vera
vera search output.vera "stream buffer requirements" --mode hybrid
vera search ./library "stream buffer requirements"   # search a folder of .vera files
vera export output.vera original.pdf                 # get the source document back out
```

Python:

```python
from vera import convert, VeraDocument

convert("input.pdf", "output.vera")

doc = VeraDocument.open("output.vera")
results = doc.search("when is detention required", mode="hybrid", top_k=5)
for r in results:
    print(r.score, r.page_start, r.heading_path)
    print(r.text)

# Visual grounding: where on the page did this chunk come from?
for region in doc.regions_for(results[0]):
    print(region["page_number"], region["bbox"])  # [x0, y0, x1, y1] in page points

# The original PDF is stored inside the .vera file
source = doc.get_source_document()                # filename, mime_type, data, hash
doc.export_source_document("original.pdf")
```

Search many documents at once:

```python
from vera import VeraCorpus

with VeraCorpus.open("./library") as corpus:      # a folder of .vera files
    for r in corpus.search("when is detention required", top_k=5):
        print(r.file, r.page_start, r.text[:80])  # each result knows its file
```

## Features

- **Single-file format** — a `.vera` file is a normal SQLite database with a standardized schema. No server, no vector database, no re-ingestion to open one.
- **Three search modes** — `semantic` (brute-force cosine over stored embeddings), `keyword` (SQLite FTS5 / bm25), and `hybrid` (both score sets min-max normalized and blended equally).
- **Structured parsing** — headings are detected from font size/weight and produce hierarchical heading paths (`Chapter 110 > Article 5 > Parking`); rotated watermark text is filtered out; chunks never span pages and map back to their source blocks via `chunk_blocks`.
- **Figures and captions** — embedded images are extracted into the `assets` table; caption blocks ("Figure 3: Detention pond sizing diagram") are detected, flow into chunk text so figures are searchable, and are returned alongside figures:

```python
result = doc.search("detention pond sizing", top_k=1)[0]
for fig in doc.figures_for(result, include_data=True):  # figures on the result's pages
    print(fig["page_number"], fig["caption"])           # caption text or None
```

- **Pluggable embeddings** — a deterministic local hashing embedder (384-dim, zero dependencies) is the default; `--model sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` enables neural embeddings via the optional `ml` extra.
- **Visual grounding** — every chunk maps back to the page regions it came from. `doc.regions_for(result)` (or `vera search --regions`) returns page numbers and bounding boxes (page points, origin top-left) plus page dimensions, so a viewer can scroll to the page and highlight the cited text.
- **Document access** — the original source file is stored inside the archive and comes back out intact: `doc.get_source_document()` / `vera export`. Pages (`get_page`), layout blocks with bounding boxes (`get_blocks`), and stored assets (`get_asset`) are all directly accessible for building viewers.
- **Corpus search** — `VeraCorpus.open(folder)` (or `vera search <folder> "query"`) searches every `.vera` file in a directory as one collection and fuses the rankings; each result is attributed to its file.
- **Transparent** — every file records its parser, chunking strategy, and embedding model in `vera_metadata`.

## CLI

| Command | Purpose |
| ------- | ------- |
| `vera convert input.pdf output.vera` | Convert a PDF (options: `--model`, `--chunk-size`, `--overlap`) |
| `vera inspect output.vera` | Print metadata: pages, chunks, model, parser |
| `vera validate output.vera` | Check schema, counts, and index consistency |
| `vera search output.vera "query"` | Search a file — or a directory of `.vera` files — (`--mode semantic\|keyword\|hybrid`, `--top-k`, `--context-chunks`, `--figures`, `--regions`) |
| `vera export output.vera [path]` | Write the original source document back out of the archive |
| `vera eval output.vera queries.json` | Measure retrieval quality against an expected-answer query set |
| `vera mcp` | Run the MCP server (stdio) exposing VERA tools to AI agents |

Every command accepts `--json` for machine-readable output (see below).

## Using VERA with AI agents

VERA was built to give agents grounded, citation-ready context from large documents without a retrieval service. Agents can call the CLI directly — every command supports `--json` and meaningful exit codes (`validate`/`eval` exit non-zero on failure):

```bash
vera search ordinance.vera "when is detention required" --top-k 5 --json --figures --context-chunks 1
```

```json
{
  "query": "when is detention required",
  "mode": "hybrid",
  "results": [
    {
      "chunk_id": "chunk_000412",
      "score": 0.93,
      "text": "Stream channel protection shall be provided by...",
      "page_start": 120,
      "page_end": 120,
      "heading_path": "4. Implementing Stormwater Management > ...",
      "source_filename": "ordinance.pdf",
      "before_chunks": [{"chunk_id": "chunk_000411", "text": "...", "page_start": 119, "page_end": 119}],
      "after_chunks": [{"chunk_id": "chunk_000413", "text": "...", "page_start": 121, "page_end": 121}],
      "figures": [
        {"page_number": 120, "caption": "Figure 4-1: Detention sizing", "asset_id": "asset_block_000371", "...": "..."}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Every result carries its citation (source file, page, heading path), so agent answers can point back to the exact location in the source document. `--figures` adds metadata and captions for images on the result's pages, and `--context-chunks N` adds N chunks before and after each result as `before_chunks` and `after_chunks`. Add `--regions` and each result also carries a `regions` array — the page numbers and bounding boxes (`[x0, y0, x1, y1]` in page points, origin top-left, with page dimensions) of the blocks the chunk came from — so a viewer can scroll to the citation and highlight it. Point `vera search` at a directory instead of a file and the agent searches every `.vera` file in it as one corpus, with each result attributed to its `file`.

### MCP server

VERA also ships a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server so MCP-capable agents can use VERA as native tools — `vera_search`, `vera_corpus_search`, `vera_inspect`, `vera_validate`, `vera_figures`, `vera_get_page`, and `vera_get_chunk_regions`. Install the `mcp` extra and point your client at `vera mcp`:

```bash
pip install vera-cli "vera-doc[mcp]"
```

Example VS Code configuration (`.vscode/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "vera": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--extra", "mcp", "vera", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and [skills/vera/SKILL.md](skills/vera/SKILL.md) for agent-facing usage guidance.

## Testing & retrieval evaluation

Run the automated suite (140 tests, also run in CI on Ubuntu/Windows × Python 3.10/3.12):

```bash
uv run --extra dev python -m pytest -q
```

Measure retrieval quality against an expected-answer query set:

```bash
uv run python -m vera_cli eval output.vera queries.json --mode all --top-k 5
```

Query files are JSON (or YAML with pyyaml installed) lists of cases:

```json
[
  {"query": "restaurant parking", "expected_pages": [42, 43], "expected_terms": ["parking"]}
]
```

The command reports hit rate and MRR per search mode and exits non-zero on any miss — handy for CI regression checks. Example sets in [examples/](examples/):

- [examples/docling-queries.json](examples/docling-queries.json) — technical paper, lexical queries
- [examples/docling-paraphrase-queries.json](examples/docling-paraphrase-queries.json) — zero vocabulary overlap, stresses semantic search
- [examples/gsmm-queries.json](examples/gsmm-queries.json) — 1,038-page stormwater manual, real-world regulatory queries

Current baseline on the stormwater manual (2,442 chunks, hashing embedder): hybrid and keyword both hit 9/10 at MRR 0.900.

## VERA Desktop App

The app package is an Electron desktop shell with a React UI and a Python sidecar that calls `vera-doc` directly:

```bash
npm run app:install
npm run app:dev
npm run app:dist
```

Run these from the repo root. The desktop app can pick local `.vera` archives or folders, inspect and validate archives, search documents or corpora with context and visual grounding, convert PDFs with parser/model settings, view embedded source PDFs as scrollable pages with selectable text and evidence highlights, preview figures, and export the embedded source document through the sidecar protocol. The unpacked Windows build writes `VERA.exe` under `packages/vera-app/release/win-unpacked`. See [docs/desktop-app-architecture.md](docs/desktop-app-architecture.md) for the app architecture and next steps.

## Status

VERA is v0.1 and experimental. The schema and format may change. See [docs/vera-spec-v0.1.md](docs/vera-spec-v0.1.md) for the format specification.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the project boundaries between the core document engine, CLI, and desktop app layer.
